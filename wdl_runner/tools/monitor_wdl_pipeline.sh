# monitor_wdl_pipeline.sh
#
# Simple script that can be used to monitor the status of a WDL pipeline
# launched using workflows/wdl_pipeline.sh or workflows/wdl_pipeline_from_git.sh
# and run by the Broad's Cromwell (https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell).
#
# The script accepts an operation ID for a pipeline, extracts the
# LOGGING, WORKSPACE, and OUTPUT directories from the operation and then
# examines these directories to glean some insights into the status of the
# operation.
#
# Note: if the WORKSPACE and/or OUTPUT directories for the specified operation
#       are already populated (for example by another operation), this script
#       will emit incorrect output.

  # directory contains objects like:
  #   exec.sh -- The code that gets executed on the VM.
  #   <stage>-rc.txt -- Contains the return code for the stage.
  #                     This file will not be exist until the stage completes.
  #                     If the VM is preempted, this file will never be written.
  #   <stage>-stdout.txt -- stdout captured during execution of exec.sh.
  #   <stage>-stderr.txt -- stderr captured during execution of exec.sh.
  #   <stage>.txt -- Genomics Pipeliens operations log.
  #
  # If the stage is sharded, then for each shard there will be a folder under
  # call-<stage> named "shard-<n>" where numbering starts at 0.
  #
  # If the Pipelines VM was preempted, then a subdirectory will be found under
  # call-<stage> named "attempt-<m>" where numbering starts at 2.

  # call-<stage>/shard-<n>/attempt-<m>

  #   has completed.
  # All "attempt-*/exec.sh" files: indicates that a previous attempt failed
  #   and is assume to be due to preemption (*this is *not* checked explicitly).
