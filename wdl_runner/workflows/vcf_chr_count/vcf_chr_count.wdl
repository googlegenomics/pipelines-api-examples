# vcf_chr_count.wdl
#
# Example workflow which features 3 stages, including a scatter-gather
# stage. The workflow takes as input a VCF file and a comma-separated list
# of chromosomes. The output is a list of each chromosome and the number
# of matching records in the VCF file.
#
# This workflow is NOT the most efficient way to perform this operation
# (as it creates separate pipelines/VMs for some very short stages),
# but is intended as a simple example to demonstrate how to create a
# multi-stage workflow and use a scatter stage.
#
# The first stage splits the VCF into separate files for each chromosome
# in the input list. Each chromosome must exactly match the value in the
# CHROM column (so be sure to use "chr7" instead of "7" if that is the
# value in the CHROM column).
#
# The second stage is a "scatter" stage such that each file is processed
# separately. The individual tasks simply run a wordcount for the total
# number of lines.
#
# The third stage aggregates (gathers) the results of the scatter stage.

# task vcf_split
#
# Accepts a VCF as an input file, along with a comma-separated
# list of chromosome names. The records from the VCF whose CHROM field
# matching the chromosome will be emitted to a chromosome-specific file.
